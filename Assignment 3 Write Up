Assignment 3: Regression Analysis 

Dataset Description 
The “ToothGrowth” dataset contains the results of an experiment studying the effects of Vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs. The dataset includes 60 results with two key variables. This analysis uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), a linear regression model, model evaluation, and prediction. The goal is to determine how dose and supplement type impact tooth length and assess how well the model fits the data. 
-	supp: type of supplement used – vitamin C and orange juice (categorical) 
-	len: tooth length (numeric) 
-	dose: dosage in milligrams (numeric) 

Model Evaluation 
The residual plots show a reasonably linear pattern without strong deviations, suggesting that the linear model assumptions are generally met. The residual vs. fitted plot does not show major heteroscedasticity, and the Q-Q plot suggests the residuals are approximately normal. 

The regression output typically finds: 
-	dose is a strong positive indicator of tooth growth 
-	Orange juice tends to increase tooth length more compared to vitamin C at the same dose.
-	The R-squared exceeds 0.70, indicating that most variation in tooth length is explained by dose and supplement type (OJ vs VC). 

Conclusion 
This analysis shows that dosage has the strongest effect on tooth length: as the dose increases, tooth growth increases consistently. The supplement type also plays a role; orange juice produces slightly higher tooth length than vitamin C after controlling for dosage. The linear regression performed well, with a strong R-squared value and acceptable residual behavior. 
Predictions for a 1.5 mg dose show higher expected tooth length for OJ than VC, supporting the model’s findings. Overall, this dataset shows a clear dose-dependent tooth development, and supplement type influences this growth but to a lesser degree. The model is appropriate for prediction and interpretation within the observed dose range.
